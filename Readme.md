<h3>Image Processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Compute the histogram of Color Image. The
        script also has to plot the histograms of each band of the image separately (Read, Green, and
        Blue), as well as the gray level intensity image resulting of averaging the color bands. Use
        OpenCV, numpy, and Matplot to load, process, and visualize the information.
